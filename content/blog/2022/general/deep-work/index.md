I read the book [Deep Work, by Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/), several months ago and wanted to write a summary of the main takeaways I found within it. Originally I planned to write this not long after reading the book, but life happens... On a positive note, it's given me a chance to really see what parts stuck with me after finishing the book many months ago.

There are many things in Deep Work that I agree with or have made improvements to my work; however, there are points that I disagree with or do not place as much importance upon.

Before I start, remember this is a summary, my summary more precisely. I'm not going to replace the act of reading the book itself. I'll highlight parts that I found interesting and/or beneficial. Im not trying to advertise the book, I swear, but if you want or need more after reading this, then you'll probably have to buy the book!

## Deep Work Is Valuable

The first chapter of the book explains why the author believes deep work is valuable.

Below are some quotes from this chapter:

> "The ability to quickly master hard things." (page 29)

> "High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus) (page 40)

## Deep Work Is Rare

Life is full of distractions: emails, instant messaging and social media, all negatively affect our ability to focus. These points aren't entirely novel, you've probably thought this yourself or saw others discussing it; however, the thought that quick and easy access to information could be reducing your capability to plan and prepare was new to me.

> "The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment." (page 58)

> "If you couldn't count on this quick response time you'd instead have to do more advance planning for your work, be more organized, and be prepared to put things aside for a while and turn your attention elsewhere while waiting for what you requested." (page 58)

Personally, I used to have a tendency to run head first into my work and then ask questions to the first issues I faced. This solved the immediate problem, but inevitably I would have another issue and another question and so on. So why did I do it? Because it was the easiest thing to do.

Thankfully I've moved away from this behaviour, and these quotes collected and labelled positive habits that I've adopted.
## Deep Work Is Meaningful

The most significant part to me for _why_ we should work deeply came in this chapter. An explanation of "Flow state", which as Software Engineer I've heard thrown around and have experienced first hand, really struck a cord with me.

> "The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile." (page 84, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi)

This quote got to the core of why I felt frustrated about my current working habits and why I sought out this book. I was rarely entering a flow state anymore, and as a consequence, I waa rarely enjoying my job anymore.

So I read on with vigor in search of guidance.

## Rule #1 Work Deeply

The previous chapters covered the _why_ and now the book moves onto the _how_.

This chapter shares information on ways that you might increase your focus and lower the boundary into switching into a flow state.

The author details different philosophies on deep working:

- Monastic:
  - Purposely being hard to reach to reduce distractions.
  - Assign large periods of time to focus, could be weeks or months.
- Bimodal:
  - Separating your time, where blocks are spent in deep work and others are open to everything else.
  - Assign blocks of time to focus, could be days to weeks.
- Rhythmic:
  - Create a habit of having deep work sessions.
  - Generate a rhythm for this style of work so it doesn't take energy to continue doing it.
  - Assign specific times within a day to focus.
- Journalistic:
  - Switch into a deep work state whenever you have the time available to do so.
  - Hard to follow, because it requires flipping a switch into flow mode.
  - Requires a lot of willpower to stick to.

For me the "Rhythmic" philosophy appealed to me the most. Especially for someone who was finding it extremely hard to focus before reading this book, the systemic process of a schedule gave me a way to hold myself accountable. 

At the time of writing, several months after reading Deep Work, I have scheduled a reoccurring meeting in my calendar for focusing. I pick a singular task, evict distractions and focus soley on the task until I've reached the end of the "focus" time. I started off scheduling 30 minute blocks and progressed to 1 hour blocks throughout the day.

I don't always stick to my schedule, if I don't have a task which I can focus all my time on, then I might cancel my "focus" time or I'll accept that I can still focus on a few tasks, but I won't complete any deep work.

This chapter also says you __should__ be __lazy__. Now that's a bold statement. Before you take it literally, and stop reading here because you decided to be lazy, let me give you some extra context.

You should be lazy, in that, you don't work all the time. You need time to recharge. This recovery time will help you perform during your working hours as your mind will be refreshed and ready to work deeply. Furthermore, deep work can be really draining, and if you are successfully working in that way for long periods of the day, you will eventually run out of gas. Forcing yourself to keep going might get some extra work done, but you'll be sacrificing the energy and willpower reserved for the next day. The author also points out, that the work you're doing so late in the day, is probably work that isn't all that important. Meaning you're burning yourself out for tasks that don't provide much value.

## Rule #2 Embrace Boredom

> "The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained." (page 157)

> "Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don't simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence of distraction." (page 157)

As described earlier in this post and in the book, life is full of distractions and if you always submit to them, then you'll never refine your ability to truly focus.

> "Don't Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus." (page 159)

For me, this works alongside my scheduled focus time, giving me a "reward" for focusing for a period of time. I give myself time to relax without feeling guilty because I know I just completed quality work (most of the time), rather than the opposite, where I feel bad while being distracted which almost creates a cycle of distraction that can be hard to break from.

This chapter details much more extreme methods of having blocks of time without distractions, but personally I didn't really gravitate towards them.

The author also writes about trying to think deeply while you're physically but not mentally distracted. This could be walking, running, cooking, cleaning and many more. For me, I've stopped listening to podcasts/music so much when walking around; instead focusing on my own thoughts about work, life or whatever I currently see. This has helped me eek out some useful insights without having to set aside specific time to think about something.

# Rule #3 Quit Social Media

While I agree with a lot of what was written in this chapter. I don't feel that it really gave noteworthy points that I'd like to write in this post.

Onto the next one.

## Rule #4 Drain the Shallows

Similar to life being full of distractions, there is also a good chance that significant amounts of your time are spent on tasks that don't require much thought or focus. These are low value tasks that need to be done, but if scattered throughout the day provide constant distractions preventing you from sitting down and really focusing on a singular piece of work.

This chapter advises you to consider how much time you spend on these sort of tasks and when you do them.

> "Quantify the Depth of Every Activity" (page 228)

Once you know what tasks deliver the most value, prioritising the order you complete them and put your energy into becomes clearer. 

That being said, sometimes these "low value" tasks might be urgent or unblock others, so figuring out the ranking between tasks isn't always cut and dry. This book is written from the perspective of a professor (since that is the author's profession), which doesn't always transfer over cleanly to working professionals. For example, as a Software Engineer, I have to review my team's code, while some reviews might seem low value to me, not reviewing them negatively impacts my team.

> "Schedule Every Minute of Your Day" (page 221)

I do believe there is a benefit in scheduling more of your time. By consciously deciding what you want to do beforehand gives you a target to aim for with the time you spend, more precisely focusing your energy.

You might find that in your "unstructured" time you don't get so much done because you're constantly trying to determine _what_ to do next. With your mind constantly flicking from one thought to another and stopping you from giving any of these thoughts any real attention.

I solve my problem of reviewing code mentioned a moment ago by blocking off time to do them. Even if some of them are "low value", grouping them together and giving direction to my time improves the overall quality of the reviews I give. Even if there is a context switch between each review, staying in the mindset of "I'm doing reviews" is extremely beneficial.

Now, I'm not saying do it from every minute of your day. However, being more aware how you spend your time can be enlightening.

> "Do More Work When You Send or Reply to E-mails" (page 248)

I've been putting more effort in providing well-written emails, including enough information and next-steps or outcomes needs from the recipients increasing the likelihood they reply with precise emails themselves. 

If I wrote emails missing information, they might have to contact me again to ask for more context. If I wrote emails not specifying the outcome I want, the feedback I'd receive might be undirected and not deep enough in the desired areas.  Both of these lead to each side investing more energy into reaching the original outcome of the email.

> "What is the project represented by this message, and what is the most efficient (in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this project too a successful conclusion?" (page 249)

The content in a "good" email will always vary, but the point above should give you a strong foundation to work from.

## My Main takeaways

My main takeaway from reading Deep Work is that I must be deliberate in the decisions I make.

Hoping to move away from being constantly distracted, aimless and unmotivated, and into someone that can focus deeply in a directed manner is pointless. Instead, I have to consciously work to address these flaws.

For me, scheduling more of my time as "focus" time has worked wonders.

I'm getting vast amounts of quality work done during these periods, I'm more easily entering a flow state, and most importantly, I'm finding enjoyment in my work again. 

I can't promise that the same changes will work for you, but it might be worth a try.

This has been my summary of [Deep Work, by Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/). I hope what I've wrote is useful to you, giving you some pointers; however, I do recommend reading the book itself.

  - "Ritualize" (117)
    - Create a routine that you follow to make starting and performing deep work easier.
    - Make it easier to flip the switch into "flow" mode.
    - Effective ritual must answer these:
      - "Where you'll work and for how long"
      - "How you'll work once you start to work"
        - E.g. No internet or maintain a metric of how much work is produced.
      - "How you'll support you work"
        - That you;ve eaten correctly before hand, drunk something that gets you in the mood.
        - Exercise to clear the mind.
  - "Make Grand Gestures" (121)
    - Decide to go work somewhere, specifically with the intention of working.
    - If it was expensive or far away, your desire to work will increase since you know you went there with a reason.
  - "Don't Work Alone" (126)
    - "Properly leveraging collaboration can increase the quality of deep work" (quote from page 126)
    - Open office can hurt concentration but can increase the ability to collaborate and find new ideas by discussing topics with peers.
    - However, the negatives of open offices likely outweigh the upsides in regards to deep work and producing quality work.
  - "Execute Like a Business" (134)
    - "The 4 Disciplines of Execution" (136)
      1) "Focus on the Wildly Important"
        - "Identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours" (137)
      2) "Act of the Lead Measures" (137)
        - "lag" measures 
          - "Describe the thing you're ultimately trying to improve".
          - Comes too late to change your behaviour.
        - "lead" measures
          - "measure the new behaviours that will drive success on the lag measures"
          - "time spent in a state of deep work dedicated to your wildly important goal" (138)
      3) "Keep a Compelling Scoreboard" (139)
        - "People play differently when they're keeping score"
        - The author kept track of the number of hours that they spent in deep work each week.
      4) "Create a Cadence of Accountability" (140)
        - Review how well you've been working at the end/start of the week and adjust hours spent in deep work or distractions preventing you from doing so.
  - "Be Lazy" (142)
    - Have a specific time where you stop working until the next morning. No emails etc...
    1) "Downtime Aids Insights" (144)
      - "Some decisions are better left to your unconscious mind to untangle"
      - Actively working through these decisions can actually lead to worse outcomes.
    2) "Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply" (146)
      - Studies supporting "Attention restoration theory (ART)"
      - Going on walks in nature can help you perform better and allow your unconscious mind to process thoughts.
      - Helps recharge willpower.
      - Nature is a good example since it is easy to navigate while having interesting stimuli. Crowded streets require more brainpower to navigate.
      - Simply having time where you are not working but not having to think to hard has the same benefits.
      - Constantly bringing attention back to work with emails or slack can harm this recovery.
    3) "The Work The Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not That Important" (149)
      - Generally people can only do a few hours of deep work a day until they run out of willpower.
      - If you have done deep work during the day, the likelihood is that you do not have enough willpower left to work effectively at this point in the day.
      - So the tasks you probably would work on are going to require lower cognitive load and therefore and probably less important and could wait.
    - Have a "shutdown ritual" (151)
      - Increases the probability that you stop for the day.
      - Review the work you did for the day and what you need to do the next day and have a plan to address them. If you don't make a plan, then have all the information prepared so you can determine that the next day.
      - Ensures that you don't have to worry about if there is something you didn't complete since you have checked.

2) Rule #2 Embrace Boredom (155)
  - "The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained" (157)
  - "Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don't simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence of distraction" (157)
  - "Don't Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus" (159)
    - Schedule when you'll use the internet and don't use it outside these times.
    - Helps prevent constant context switching.
    - "For example, if you've scheduled your next Internet block thirty minutes from the current moment, and you're beginning to feel bored and crave distraction, the next thirty minutes of resistance become a session of concentration calisthenics" (162)
    1) "This strategy works even if your job requires lots of Internet use and/or prompt email replies" (162)
      - If you need to use the internet more often (to send emails) then have more blocks where you allow yourself to use the Internet.
      - The number of blocks doesn't particularly matter, more that you maintain the structure you imposed.
    2) "Regardless of how your schedule your Internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use". (163)
      - "Easy to state in principle but quickly becomes tricky in the messy reality of the standard workday"
      - Try switch onto another offline task or spend time relaxing.
      - Use the Internet if there is really no way to progress or it is urgent.
    3) "Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training" (164)
      - Your habits outside of work have a high chance of undoing any progress you've made in changing your habits during the work day.
      - The primary idea isn't to not use the internet at all, it is to practice restraint. Even if you spend most of your time using it, knowing that there are periods where you won't and can restrain yourself from doing so improves self-control.
  - "Meditate Productively" (169)
    - "The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you're occupied physically but not mentally" (170)
      - Walking, jogging, driving, showering etc.
    - The goal of this task is to practice rapidly deep thinking.
    - Starts off unproductive but eventually becomes easier to focus and produces more output.
    1) "Be Wary of Distractions and Looping" (172)
      - Your mind might start filling your thoughts with unrelated thoughts that might seem more interesting in the moment.
      - Actively try and draw your attention back to what you're intending to focus on.
      - You might also constantly loop over things you already know instead of thinking deeper and progressing with a problem.
      - Need to notice when you enter this loop and actively think of a next step to get your thoughts moving.
    2) "Structure your Deep Thinking" (173)
      - "Review of the relevant variables for solving the problem and then storing these values in your working memory" (173)
      - Thinking of questions to go over during this time.
      - Consolidate your thoughts afterwards by reviewing the answers you identified.

3) Rule #3 Quit Social Media

4) Rule #4 Drain the Shallows (215)
- "Schedule Every Minute of Your Day" (221)
  - People badly estimate the time they allocate to activities.
  - "We spend much of our day on autopilot - not giving much thought to what we're doing with our time" (222)
  - Split your workday into blocks and assign activities to these blocks.
    - Block off extra time than you think you might need so you aren't constantly redefining your schedule.
    - But do not let your schedule dictate you if you think you have a thought that is extremely important and should be acted upon.
- "Quantify the Depth of Every Activity" (228)
  - If you know how shallow a task is (how important it is or effort it requires) you can bias tasks the require deeper, meaningful work.
- "Ask Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget" (232)
  - "What percentage of my time should be spent on shallow work?" (232)
  - Probably around 30% of your time, depends on your role.
  - Making this agreement with your boss means that you're on the same page and it doesn't seem like your neglecting part of your role by purposely reducing the amount of time/frequency spent on shallow work.
- "Finish Your Work by Five Thirty" (236)
  - Choose a time that you aim to finish work and then work backwards to determine how to satisfy this goal.
  - "Fixed-schedule productivity" (236)
  - Forces you to turn down activities that might provide some benefit, but don't work towards you completing your outcome well and on time.
- "Become Hard to Reach" (242)
  1) "Make People Who Send You E-mail Do More Work"
    - Have a filter that people must pass if you are to respond.
    - People will either not contact you or will better summarise their needs and reduce the effort for you to interact with them.
    - Sets expectations, in that people know that you might not respond.
  2) "Do More Work When You Send or Reply to E-mails" (248)
    - "Process centric approach to email" (249)
    - "What is the project represented by this message, and what is the most efficient (in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this project too a successful conclusion?" (249).
    - By putting in more effort and taking the initiative in your emails, it reduces the back and forth between senders since their are less things "up in the air".
  3) "Don't Respond" (253)
    - Forces people to send more detailed messages, because you won't respond otherwise.

## Interesting quotes

- "Deliberate practice is the systematic stretching of your ability for a given skill.  It is the activity required to get better at something. Deep work and deliberate practice, as I've argued, overlap substantially." (149)
