This is the talk I gave at CordaCon in October.

Title: A tale of Corda Slack adventures - Common CorDapp mistakes and how to fix them

The talk covers the following topics:

- Remembering the `@Suspendable` annotation
- Contract validation
- Responder flow validation
- Balancing `send`s and `receive`s in your flows

The laptop that ran the presentation didn't support the emojis I added, so sorry for the random symbols you'll see in the talk.
